   Timewarrior is a companion to Taskwarrior, which tracks time, and then
            shows reports. It is intended to replace the
   <code>
    timesheet
   </code>
   command in Taskwarrior, and add much, much more.

   As an alpha release, we hope you will download it and try it out.
            This is new software, and only an alpha release, so there are lots
            of rough edges and missing pieces. We are hoping for feedback, so we
            can guide it towards a fully functional beta, and full release.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are quite a few features implemented and loads more coming.
