   We'd like to thank
   <a href="https://www.hellotux.com/">
    HELLOTUX
   </a>
   for doing a fantastic job designing embroidered apparel for
            Taskwarrior fans.

            This is the real thing - quality embroidery, not merely printed.

   HELLOTUX says:
   <i>
    "... an offer for all the devs and fans of
            Taskwarrior: if you order 3 or more shirts or sweaters (one of them
            must be a Taskwarrior one) by this Friday (2017-03-10), we give a
            bonus Taskwarrior t-shirt for free. Just write in the comment field
            the color (black/write) when ordering."
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Taskwarrior project receives some money for each item sold.
            Don't let this discourage you from also sending us bags of cash.
