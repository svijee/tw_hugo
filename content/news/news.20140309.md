   New system status pages are online, which provide up to the minute
            status for the various services now online.

            The first is a Pingdom public report showing
   <a href="http://status.tasktools.org/">
    system status
   </a>
   of the bug system, git hosting, web services and others.

            Check this page for outages.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second is an
   <a href="http://statuspage.tasktools.org/">
    operations information
   </a>
   page from
   <a href="http://statuspage.io/">
    StatusPage.io
   </a>
   which shows status, uptime, response time and incidents.
  </p>
  <p>
   You'll find links to the new status pages in the page footer on the
            front page.
  </p>
  <p>
   We would like to thank Pingdom and StatusPage.io for the generous
            donation of their services.
