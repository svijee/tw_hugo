   Code Repositories Moved
   <small>
    2017-04-02
   </small>
  </h3>
  <p>
   The code repositories have been relocated to our new
   <a href="https://gitea.io/en-US/">
    Gitea
   </a>
   server.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gitea is a community managed fork of Gogs, lightweight code hosting
            solution written in Go and published under the MIT license.
            We like all of those things.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can browse all our repositories here:
  </p>
  <a href="https://git.tasktools.org">
   <pre>https://git.tasktools.org</pre>
  </a>
  <p>
   This means that there are several source-level packages which will
            temporarily have the old URL. They will catch up.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are a developer with a repository clone, you'll need to update
            the remote to the new URLs (task.git and libshared.git), as well as
            modify the
   <code>
    .gitmodules
   </code>
   file.
