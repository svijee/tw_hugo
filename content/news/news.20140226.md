   We have shut off the registration of users on this site. This is
            part of our ongoing migration to new systems. This taskwarrior.org
            site content will be replaced soon, but the URLs will not change.
  </p>
  <p>
   All user accounts created prior to 2014-02-09 are already migrated
            over to the new issue tracking system. The newer accounts will be
            migrated shortly. To add bugs and feature requests please use:

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   We will be without forums while the new system is brought online,
            which may take a little time. If you have questions, please use
            IRC #taskwarrior at freenode, or email
   <a href="mailto:support@taskwarrior.org">
    support@taskwarrior.org
   </a>
   in the meantime. We will be back online soon with better support
            options.
