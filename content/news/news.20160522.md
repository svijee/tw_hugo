  <p>
   The
   <a href="/tools/">
    Taskwarrior Tools page
   </a>
   now has interactive
            categorized search capabilities, thanks to a significant contribution
            by Bruno Vernay. We encourage you to take a look.
  </p>
  <p>
   This feature is driven by automated
   <a href="https://github.com">
    Github
   </a>
   data extraction, which identifies taskwarrior-related projects and
            finds their metadata.
  </p>
  <p>
   Future enhancements will likely include other sources of projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before today, the tools list was manually curated, and a fraction of
            the size. It took many hours to update the list. Thank you Bruno.
