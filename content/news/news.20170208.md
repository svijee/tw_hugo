   FOSDEM 2017: Reprise

  </h3>
  <p>
   It was the first time the whole Taskwarrior Team met in carbon space.
  </p>
  <p>
   What do you get when people from the US, the Czech Republic, Germany,
            Sweden und Switzerland meet for the first time?
  </p>
  <p>
   A lot of fun!
  </p>
  <p>
   We had a great time sharing thoughts and ideas, drinking beer and
            discussing various topics.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are some highlights to share:
   <ul>
    <li>
     The rooms were really small, so we had to meet in the hotel lobby
                and talk to each other (what a pity ...).
    </li>
    <li>
     It was all about meeting people. At FOSDEM we were recognized and
                people talked to us. Thank you! It was really nice seeing all of
                you.
    </li>
    <li>
     You like our stickers, we do so as well. It is good to have some.
    </li>
    <li>
     Due to intense bandwidth testing, we can tell you, you were able
                to get a downstream of 21 MBit/s. If you were not able to get the
                same, it was our fault because of testing ...
    </li>
    <li>
     The hotel wifi was incredibly rate limited. A download of an 1.3 GB
                iso file took seven hours (over night).
    </li>
    <li>
     We had great tasting coffee at the FOSDEM cafeteria. Thank you!
    </li>
    <li>
     Pommes frites are great as well ...
    </li>
    <li>
     Per Bacco is an absolutely fabulous Italian restaurant. We
                recommend it to everyone. We went for there three evenings in a
                row. Hint: Take the Quattro Formaggio pizza.
    </li>
    <li>
     People at FOSDEM were really nice except the six of us.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   We liked the get together very much and plan on doing this again, maybe
            in a town near you.
