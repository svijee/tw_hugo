  <p>
   We’re looking for someone to assume the responsibility of packaging
            Taskwarrior etc for Cygwin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cygwin doesn’t get the care and attention from us that it should.
            We often skip releasing on Cygwin because we don’t have the
            equipment and must borrow it, and furthermore don’t use Cygwin day
            to day, so every package update involves a full install, and it
            takes hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   The folks who do rely on and enjoy Cygwin deserve timely updates
            for every release. Can you do a better job that we have? Know
            someone who can? Please
   <a href="mailto:support@taskwarrior.org">
    contact us

   .
