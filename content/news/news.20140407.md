   Q &amp; A Site Launched

  </h3>
  <p>
   The new Q &amp; A site is live! Take a look at the site, which can
            be found here:

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a searchable knowledge base of community-provided questions
            and answers. The answers are voted and selected, good answers
            becomes more prominent, bad answers sink lower.  You know how it
            works.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a brand new site, the content is a little light right now, but as
            the questions come in, we believe this will grow into the primary
            resource for all those situations you need a little help with.
