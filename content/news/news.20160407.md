   Taskwarrior running under "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows"

  <p>
   Today we could verify that Taskwarrior works out of the box under "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10".
            Either by installing it via apt-get (which pulls the regular Ubuntu package) or by compiling it.
            No changes needed to the source code. You compile it as you would do it on native Ubuntu.  A few
            tests were failing. But no major ones. Enjoy the screenshot and enjoy the thoughts of being able
            to abandon Cygwin soon, if you are using Taskwarrior on Windows.
