  <p>
   Since a couple of weeks ago the resolving of our hostnames and domains
            is handled via services of dnsimple. They are kindly enough to sponsor
            the taskwarrior project. We will not only profit from the
   <em>
    developer
            friendly
   </em>
   management console but in particular from the powerful API
            to handle our DNS tasks when we move towards our new CI system
   <em>
    flod2
   </em>
   .
