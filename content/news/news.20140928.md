   Rackspace has announced that it will reboot all of its cloud server infrastructure joining other hosting providers. The data center we are hosted in is the third in the row of IAD, DFW and ORD. The announced maintenance window is from 2014-09-28 1100 UTC to 2014-09-29 1101 UTC. This will cause interruptions here at taskwarrior.org. You can follow the status at
