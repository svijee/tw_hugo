   Tasksh 1.0.0 Released

  </h3>
  <p>
   The taskwarrior shell, tasksh 1.0.0, is released.
  </p>
  <p>
   Up to, and including, Taskwarrior 2.3.0, the
   <code>
    shell
   </code>
   command implemented this functionality. Starting with Taskwarrior
            2.4.0, there is no
   <code>
    shell
   </code>
   command. Instead there is the
   <code>
    tasksh
   </code>
   project.

  </a>
  <p>
   The tasksh supports libreadline, although can be built without it.
            Libreadline provides command history and command editing.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a separate project, tasksh can innovate and release on its own
            schedule, as it remains independent of Taskwarrior, and supports all
            known releases. It achieves this by having almost no features.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1.0.0 release is a starting point, a platform on which we can
            build interesting capabilities that are external to Taskwarrior.
  </p>
  <p>
   The release is available as a source
