  <p>
   Tasksh, the Taskwarrior Shell, can now be installed using
   <a href="http://brew.sh">
    Homebrew
   </a>
   on the Mac:
  </p>
  <pre>$ brew install tasksh</pre>
  <p>
   This means that all three related Taskwarrior family members can
            now be installed via Homebrew:
  </p>
  <pre>$ brew install task
...
$ brew install taskd
...
$ brew install tasksh
...</pre>
  <p>
   Existing Homebrew users can obtain the formulae:
  </p>
  <pre>$ brew update
...</pre>
  <p>
   Then later upgrade their Task software easily:
  </p>
  <pre>$ brew upgrade
...</pre>
