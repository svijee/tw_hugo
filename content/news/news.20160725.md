   Timewarrior is a companion to Taskwarrior, which tracks time, and then
            shows reports. It is intended to replace the
   <code>
    timesheet
   </code>
   command in Taskwarrior, and add much, much more.

   As a beta release, we hope you will download it and try it out.
            While Timewarrior has all it's 1.0-level features, it likely still
            has a few bugs, and the purpose of the beta release is to find and
            fix those.

            Your feedback will help us prepare Timewarrior for full release.
