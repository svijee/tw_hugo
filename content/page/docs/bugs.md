  <p>
   Please report bugs and odd behavior when you see it. We don't
              necessarily know it's broken, unless you tell us. A good bug
              description improves response time and reduces the burden on the
              developers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It helps if you first determine whether this is a known bug.  To
              do this, you will need to look at the current list of bugs here:

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   If you don't see the bug listed, sign up for an account at the
              link above, and create a new issue.  Please include the following
              information, as it helps us categorize, prioritize and replicate
              the problem:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Tell us
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     what command you ran
    </li>
    <li>
     Tell us what happened
    </li>
    <li>
     Tell us what you expected to happen
    </li>
    <li>
     Tell us about your installation, by running the command
     <code>
      task diagnostics
     </code>
     and including the output in the issue description.
                  Notice that the
     <code>
      diagnostics
     </code>
     command was added
                  specifically for reporting issues, and it gives us information
                  about your operating system, libraries, compiler and so on.
                  If you feel some of the information is personal, then remove
                  that line.
    </li>

     If you need to demonstrate a problem with a screenshot, you
                  can hide your private data with the
     <code>
      rc.obfuscate=1
     </code>
     configuration override:
     <p>
      <a href="/docs/images/obfuscate.png">
       <img alt="Data Obfuscation" class="img-thumbnail" src="/docs/images/obfuscate.png"/>
      </a>
     </p>
