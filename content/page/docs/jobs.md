   With a family of Open Source projects, there is always work to be
              done. We need help, in all kinds of areas, for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is Open Source volunteer work. The pay is zero, but you'll get
              your hands dirty in a set of active projects that need all
              different kinds of help. Perhaps you're a professional with a
              little time here and there to donate to the projects. Perhaps
              you're new to this, and would like to be active in Open Source,
              in a friendly community where you can get lots of help, make
              much-needed contributions, and maybe learn something.
  </p>
  <p>
   We believe a lot of you would like to join in, but don't know
              where to start. We'll guide you and teach you what you need.
