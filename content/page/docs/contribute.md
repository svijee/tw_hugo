   Help is needed in all areas of Taskwarrior development - design,
              coding, testing, support and marketing. Applicants must be friendly.

              Perhaps you are looking to help, but don't know where to start.
              You can of course
   <a href="mailto:taskwarrior-dev@googlegroups.com">
    email us
   </a>
   but take a look at this list. Perhaps you have skills we are
              looking for, here are ways you may be able to help:
  </p>
  <p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use Taskwarrior, become familiar with it, and make suggestions.
                  We get great feedback from both new users and veteran users.
                  New users have a fresh approach that we can no longer achieve,
                  while veteran users develop clever and crafty ways to use the
                  product.
    </li>
    <li>
     Report bugs and odd behavior when you see it. We don't
                  necessarily know it's broken, unless you tell us.
    </li>
    <li>
     Suggest enhancements. We get lots of these, and it's great.
                  Some really good ideas have been suggested and implemented.
                  Sure, some are out of scope, or plain crazy, but the stream of
                  suggestions is fascinating to think about.
    </li>
